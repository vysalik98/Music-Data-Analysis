# Music Data Analysis Project
This repository contains a DBMS (Database Management System) project focused on music data analysis. The project involves collecting various datasets related to music, performing preprocessing and cleaning tasks, writing SQL queries to extract valuable insights from the data, and utilizing Python for data visualization and query plan analysis.

## Project Components
The project is divided into two main parts:

## Part 1: Dataset Collection, Preprocessing, and SQL Queries
In this phase, several music datasets were collected, including information about artists, albums, tracks, genres, and user interactions. The collected datasets were preprocessed and cleaned to ensure data quality. SQL queries were developed to explore and analyze the data, generating valuable insights and answering specific questions related to the music domain.

## Part 2: Python Integration, Visualization, and Query Plan Analysis
Building upon the previous phase, this part involved connecting to the database using Python and utilizing data visualization libraries to create meaningful visual representations of the analyzed music data. Additionally, query plans were generated and analyzed, including the creation of physical query plan tree structures, to optimize query performance and understand the underlying execution processes.

## Repository Contents
CSV files: Contains the collected music datasets in CSV format.
SQL file: Includes all the SQL queries developed for data analysis and exploration.
Project documentation: Detailed documentation of the project, including an overview of the dataset collection process, preprocessing steps, SQL query descriptions, and analysis results.
Python notebook: A Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for connecting to the database, performing visualizations, and query plan analysis.
